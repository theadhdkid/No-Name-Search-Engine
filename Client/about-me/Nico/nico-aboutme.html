      <p>
        Hello, my name is Nicolas Carrillo, but you can call me Nico. <br />

        <br />

        I'm originally from Guatemala but later moved to Chico, California,
        where I stayed until 2021. Currently, I'm a first-generation student
        enrolled in my third year at San Francisco State University, majoring in
        Computer Science with a minor in Math. I am an aspiring Full Stack
        Software Developer as well as a Digital Marketer. <br />

        <br />

        At the moment I am a contracted full stack developer at Home Stack while
        also working on an App I hope to deploy by the end of this year. I
        became interested in coding during the lockdown of COVID-19 when my
        friend and I had an idea for an app that built your closet virtually to
        share unique clothing pieces with the world. The only issue was that I
        was a Civil Engineering major at the time, while he was a Business
        major. We ended up taking an 8-hour HTML course that taught us how to
        create reactive buttons, a contact me page, and the front-end design of
        YouTubeâ€™s homepage. While practicing recreating different webpages, we
        got into CSS and a little bit of JavaScript. Once the summer ended, we
        both switched our majors to Computer Science in our second year of
        college and started our journey in Computer Science.
